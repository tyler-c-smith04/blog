<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>

I remember the days when I was too afraid to admit that my favorite baseball team was the Houston Astros. My beloved 'Stros were the laughing stock of Major League Baseball.
Between 2011 and 2013, the Astros suffered three straight 100 loss seasons. How pathetic! 2014 wasn't much better (only 92 losses, woohoo!!!), but things started to turn around in 2015
when the team made the playoffs. 2015 and 2016 gave rise to some of MLB's newest stars and 2017 marked their arrival to baseball's spotlight when they won the 2017 World Series
championship. Between 2017 and 2023, the Astros have been to seven straight ALCS's and have won two World Series. This project has been designed analyze the numbers behind the Astros'
historic run, deemed as the "Golden Era of Astros Baseball". Let's get into it.

<h2>Pitch Clock</h2>

Before jumping straight into the numbers behind the Astros performance, I'd like to present the amount of time per season that I spend biting my nails in anxiety and yelling at my TV.
In an effort to reduce gameplay in 2023, MLB introduced the controversial pitch clock. Feel free to check out this link from [MLB](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/pitch-timer)
for detailed explanations of the new rules regarding the pitch clock. The impact of the pitch clock was notable from the start. Players and coaches had mixed reactions about the pitch
clock, but the MLB absolutely succeeded in making baseball faster in 2023. Between 2022 and 2023 alone, gameplay was shortened (on average) from 185.87 minutes to 164.97 minutes
in 2023.

<h2>Season Records</h2>

In a stark contrast from the early 2010's, the Astros have reeled off four 100 win seasons between 2017 and 2023. The Astros have won at least 90 games in each season, with the exception of a shortened 2020 season where teams only played a 60 game season.

The Astros regular season success has come at the expense of many. The only teams that have winning records in this seven year span against the Astros are the Dodgers, Brewers, Padres, and Reds. Each of these teams are from the National League so the Astros do not play them each season. Among all opponents in the American League, the Astros have a winning percentage of .500 or better.

The only division in the league that the Astros do not have a winning record against is the NL Central, where the Reds and Brewers both play. Regular season dominance against the American League has translated into postseason success, as the Astros have advanced to the American League Championship Series seven straight years and represented the American League in the World Series four times in this time span.
