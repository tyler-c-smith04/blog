<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>

I remember the days when I was too afraid to admit that my favorite baseball team was the Houston Astros. My beloved 'Stros were the laughing stock of Major League Baseball.
Between 2011 and 2013, the Astros suffered three straight 100 loss seasons. How pathetic! 2014 wasn't much better (only 92 losses, woohoo!!!), but things started to turn around in 2015
when the team made the playoffs. 2015 and 2016 gave rise to some of MLB's newest stars and 2017 marked their arrival to baseball's spotlight when they won the 2017 World Series
championship. Between 2017 and 2023, the Astros have been to seven straight ALCS's and have won two World Series. This project has been designed analyze the numbers behind the Astros'
historic run, deemed as the "Golden Era of Astros Baseball". Let's get into it.

<h2>Pitch Clock</h2>

Before jumping straight into the numbers behind the Astros performance, I'd like to present the amount of time per season that I spend biting my nails in anxiety and yelling at my TV.
In an effort to reduce gameplay in 2023, MLB introduced the controversial pitch clock. Feel free to check out this link from [MLB](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/rules/pitch-timer)
for detailed explanations of the new rules regarding the pitch clock. The impact of the pitch clock was notable from the start. Players and coaches had mixed reactions about the pitch
clock, but the MLB absolutely succeeded in making baseball faster in 2023. Between 2022 and 2023 alone, Astros' gameplay was shortened (on average) from 185.87 minutes to 164.97 minutes
in 2023.

<h2>Season Records</h2>

In a stark contrast from the early 2010's, the Astros have reeled off four 100 win seasons between 2017 and 2023. The Astros have won at least 90 games in each season, with the exception of a shortened 2020 season where teams only played a 60 game season.

The Astros regular season success has come at the expense of many. The only teams that have winning records in this seven year span against the Astros are the Dodgers, Brewers, Padres, and Reds. Each of these teams are from the National League so the Astros do not play them each season, leading to smaller sample sizes than American League divisions. Among all opponents in the American League, the Astros have a winning percentage of .500 or better.

The only division in the league that the Astros do not have a winning record against is the NL Central, where the Reds and Brewers both play. Regular season dominance against the American League has translated into postseason success, as the Astros have advanced to the American League Championship Series seven straight years and represented the American League in the World Series four times in this time span.

<h2>Kings of the AL West</h2>

As members of the AL West divison, the Astros play Texas, Seattle, Oakland, and Los Angeles thirteen times each per season. The Astros' .642 win percentage against their division speaks volumes to the success that the Astros have had against their divisional foes, whom they see more than any other teams during the season. The Astros have spent a whomping 709 games over seven seasons as the the first place team in their division.

The Astros have enjoyed divisional success particularly against their neighbors to the north, the Texas Rangers. The Astros boast a .669 win percentage against Texas over the last seven seasons. After the 2023 season, I doubt anyone would believe that the team who has put up the biggest fight against the Astros in the AL West since 2017 is actually the Oakland A's. To say the A's struggled this last season might be a massive understatement. They finished 50-112 in 2023, but are surpisingly the only other team in the AL West to claim an AL West division title besides the Astros since 2017. Even though it was during a shortened COVID season, we'll give Oakland the tiniest ounce of respect for that season.

The 2023 season shed light on the emergence of the Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners as threats for the Astros in the years to come. Texas' big-name free agency signings like Jacob DeGrom, Nathan Eovaldi, Cory Seager, and Marcus Semien have set the stage for an intense in-state rivalry for years to come. The gritty Mariners never seem to go away and seem to step up to the plate (no pun intended) when they match up with Houston. Regarding the A's and the Angels: The A's are relocating to Las Vegas, and the Angels are likely to lose Shohei Ohtani in free agency. Those are the only thoughts I have about those two teams moving forward.

The Astros spent almost all of the 2017 season in first place in their division, reaching a lead of 21 games at one point. In contrast, the Astros spent most of the 2023 season in either second or third place in the division, but still ended up winning the AL West due to finishing the regular season with the same record as the Texas Rangers and owning the tie-breaker against Texas.

<h2>Elite Offense and Lockdown Defense</h2>

Since 2017, the Astros' pitching staff has pitched 68 shutout games (0 runs allowed). According to [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/bat.shtml), the average runs scored per game between 2017 and 2023 is 4.57 runs. The Astros have held opponents below the league average number of runs per games 27% of their games in this time span. The Astros' offense has scored more than the league average 66% of their games. These numbers testify of the ability for Houston's offense to put up runs in quickly and the ability of their pitching staff and defense to put the clamps on opposing hitters.
