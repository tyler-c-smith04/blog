<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>

The Houston Astros have been to seven straight American League Championship Series and have played in the World Series four of the last seven years. This historic run of success
has resulted in two World Series Championships, causing Houston natives to deem this span of seven years as the "Golden Era" of Astros baseball. For my project, I will be diving
deep into the Golden Era of Astros baseball to analyze all sorts of different metrics during the last seven regular MLB seasons.
